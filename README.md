Traditional irrigation techniques, which frequently rely on manual scheduling and flood methods, are characterized by significant water wastage, labor-intensive processes, and a deficiency in real-time environmental data, leading to inconsistent crop yields. In contrast, this study presents an advanced irrigation system employing the ESP32 micro _controller to address these issues. By integrating sensors for soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, the system provides real-time data crucial for adaptive irrigation management. The ESP32 offers automated operations that  reduce water waste, reduce labor requirements, and optimize water distribution based on certain environmental conditions. The system's remote monitoring and control capabilities, supported by wireless connectivity. This shift towards precision irrigation, informed by sensor-based decision-making, aims to improve crop yields, conserve water resources, and promote sustainability.
In agriculture, irrigation is an important method  that impacts crop production which is a major source of sustenance to the rising demand of the human population.
Studies have shown that manual watering is an inefficient technique as this contributes to a high possibility of excessive water consumption.
A sensor-based automated irrigation system provides easy tasks and an efficient solution to the farmers where their presence in the field is not necessary anymore.
Traditional irrigation methods are inefficient, leading to significant water wastage and often requiring substantial manual labor. This is particularly problematic in regions like India, where agriculture is a primary economic driver and water scarcity is an increasing concern. Furthermore, farmers may face challenges due to unreliable power supplies, such as off-peak hours and power outages, which can further complicate irrigation management and increase the risk of water and energy waste. To address these issues, there is a need for smart irrigation systems that utilize technologies like IoT and wireless sensor networks to automate the irrigation process, optimize water usage, reduce labor requirements, and adapt to varying crop needs.
